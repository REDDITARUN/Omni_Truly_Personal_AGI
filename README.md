##  A Closer Look at Omni's Modes

Omni offers three distinct modes to cater to different needs:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c3fafa3-1664-4c42-97f7-fe406df8f385)


**1. Rewind Mode**

Ever wished you could recall details from a past conversation or meeting? Rewind Mode is your answer. Use it to:

* Retrieve specific details from past events.
* Remember what was discussed during a meeting you attended last week.
* Recall a friend's favorite food preference.

**2. Focus Mode**

Need precision and clarity for a specific task? Focus Mode is here to help:

* **Focus - Idle:**  When you're attending a lecture or meeting, FocusMode passively captures and stores contextual information in your vector database for future reference.
* **Focus - Working:** When you need immediate assistance with a task, Focus Mode provides on-the-spot insights without storing unnecessary data. This is useful for summarizing documents or guiding a visually impaired user.

**Key Features of Focus Mode:**

* **Attention to Detail:** Omni processes objects, their distances, and positions, opening up possibilities like providing navigation assistance for the visually impaired.
* **Data Efficiency:** Omni avoids redundancy by storing only unique and relevant data. For example, when reading a book, Omni saves the context only once, not repeatedly for each page.

**3. Timeless Mode**

Timeless Mode blends the functionalities of Rewind and Focus, bridging the gap between past and present. Use it to:

* Solve problems by drawing on past experiences and knowledge.
* Determine if you've cooked a particular recipe with specific ingredients before.

**Key Features of Timeless Mode:**

* **Contextual Bridging:** Timeless Mode uses Gemini to connect current context with past information. For example, if you ask, "Have I learned this concept before?", Gemini combines the current context with your query and generates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) query to retrieve relevant historical data. This allows Omni to provide a more accurate and informed response.

## Why a Long Context Window is Crucial

A long context window, like the one offered by Gemini 1.5 Pro, is essential for Omni to effectively handle queries that require accessing extensive historical data. For instance, when a user asks, "Did I make this recipe before?" or "What were the details of my last meeting?", Omni might need to process months or even years of information. Without a long context window, the model wouldn't be able to retain and analyze all this data simultaneously. Even with timestamps to narrow the search, the model still needs sufficient capacity to prioritize and focus on the most relevant details.

## Why Gemini 1.5 Pro?

Gemini 1.5 Pro stands out not just for its long context window but also for its effective utilization. Compared to alternatives like Flash, Gemini 1.5 Pro excels at capturing subtle details within a broader context. This ability to balance breadth and precision makes Gemini 1.5 Pro the ideal choice for powering Omni's contextual understanding.

## Proposal: The Future of Personalized AI

Omni represents a movement towards a future where everyone has a personalized AI companion, seamlessly integrated across all their devices. Imagine your AI working across VR headsets, smartphones, and smartwatches, storing, retrieving, and adapting to your unique needs through a secure, cloud-based personalized vector database.

**Key Features of this Future:**

* **Secure Data:** Your data remains fully encrypted and accessible only to you.
* **Tailored Experience:** Your AI is customized to your preferences and history.
* **Ubiquitous Access:** Your AI is ready to assist you anytime, anywhere.

This vision goes beyond mere convenience; it's about creating a connected, smarter way of living. From syncing tasks and navigating daily life to enhancing learning and well-being, this AI will transform how you interact with technology.

## The Models Powering Omni

Omni's capabilities are driven by a powerful combination of cutting-edge models:

1.  **Gemini 1.5 Pro:** For superior context comprehension and precise responses.
2.  **DeTR ResNet 50 (or YOLO v11n):** For state-of-the-art object detection.
3.  **Depth Pro:** Apple's efficient monocular depth model for accurate depth estimation.
4.  **Whisper:** OpenAI's speech recognition model for precise audio transcription.
5.  **EasyOCR:** For streamlined text recognition from images and videos.

## Integrating the Vector Database with RAG

Omni uses a vector database (Pinecone with MPNet Base V2 embeddings) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to manage and access its vast store of contextual information.

**Why RAG?**

Even with Gemini's large context window, RAG provides a more scalable and efficient approach for managing continuously growing user data. RAG allows Omni to fetch only the most relevant chunks of data, leveraging Gemini's capacity for processing and generating insightful responses.

**How it Works:**

*   Omni uses Pinecone with MPNet Base V2 embeddings (768 dimensions) to store and retrieve contextual data.
*   The system retrieves the top 20 most relevant matches for a given query.
*   The initial dataset consists of synthetic contextual data simulating seven days of diverse real-world scenarios.


## Frame Processing and RAGManager

*   **Frame Processing:** Omni integrates object detection, depth estimation, OCR, and speech recognition to capture rich contextual information.
*   **RAGManager:** This component handles data storage, embedding, and retrieval in Pinecone, converting summaries into embeddings for efficient similarity-based querying.

## Results and Use Cases
